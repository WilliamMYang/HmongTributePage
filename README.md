This is my first project self teaching myself web development. This project is based off of freeCodeCamp.org's web design certification. 

In this project, I decide to do it on the Hmong people and the history. I found a website that has information and a timeline so I basically took some basic information and used that as a basis for my tribute page. 

I include a link to the website that i got my information from at the bottom of my page.
